do deep dependencies
fix caballint
fix makefilemake
new command line iface:
-isrc:folders
--hide-package packagename
root filenames
-> for MakeFileMake

then
blessed .tar.gz set generation + run sdist on local packages
-> pass in the root files as with above
+ pass in a list of folders where local versions of packages are
will find all the package dependencies
get rid of the ones which come with ghc
get all the .tar.gz from $CABAL_HOME for these packages
override or supply .tar.gz from local folders -> so if a package isn't
   in $CABAL_HOME at all, but one of the folders has a .cabal with
   that name, use cabal sdist to create the .tar.gz to use
   if the package is both in one of the folders and in $CABAL_HOME,
   then use the folder one as an override (emit a warning)
   if there are multiple folders with the same needed package, error
report any missing packages, but succeed with what is available



clean up command line options for makefile stuff and for other things
  follow roots, exes automatic, module names
deal with block comments better
refactor, esp. moduleinfo
deep package dependencies

check installed: dups, not latest
check stuff on cabal install --dry-run



check cabal --dry-run for dups/ not latest version:
cabal already reports reinstall and new version, highlight these a lot
   better and add highlight for versions which aren't the latest

package database checker: dup versions, non latest versions

lint: duplicate listing, unreferenced files, extensions, benchmark
   sections
refactor and document the lint, makefiler and lib modules
fix the dump exes

upgrade all: try to unregister then reinstall all cabal packages in
   latest version, or take all packages from one sandbox and install
   latest in another sandbox for testing

...


tester: use sandboxing to:
    compile and run tests -> successful compile and successful test
      run is the validation
    start with the sdist tarball
    check ghc versions: target 7.0.x through 7.6.x
    check it works with all the latest package versions in the
      dependency ranges on each ghc
    check it works with all the earliest "

third party package hacker

test the caballint on all the packages in hackage?
+ test other exes in this way

produce a big dependency diagram showing modules and packages
