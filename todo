start working through the features and implementing them
priorities:
  lint for cabal files
    list files in project which aren't included in .cabal
    check for unnecessary packages in build-depends
    check exact file list in other-module sections
    check the upper bounds
  prepare .tar.gz set
  check cabal --dry-run for dups/ not latest version
  tester: use sandboxing to:
    compile and run tests, check they pass
    check ghc versions: target 7.0.x through 7.6
    check it works with all the latest packages on each ghc
    check it works with all the minimum bounds on each ghc
