fix caballint for exes depending on the package

override or supply .tar.gz from local folders -> so if a package isn't
   in $CABAL_HOME at all, but one of the folders has a .cabal with
   that name, use cabal sdist to create the .tar.gz to use
   if the package is both in one of the folders and in $CABAL_HOME,
   then use the folder one as an override (emit a warning)
   if there are multiple folders with the same needed package, error
report any missing packages, but succeed with what is available

fix the dump exes

upgrade all: try to unregister then reinstall all cabal packages in
   latest version, or take all packages from one sandbox and install
   latest versions of same packages in another sandbox for testing


test makefilemake and caballint on a bunch of packages from hackage

tester: use sandboxing to:
    compile and run tests -> successful compile and successful test
      run is the validation
    start with the sdist tarball
    check ghc versions: target 7.0.x through 7.6.x
    check it works with all the latest package versions in the
